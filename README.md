# ML-FPGA Deployment Workflow

This repository provides an educational reference implementation of the workflow presented in the workshop  **“From Algorithm to Hardware: Machine Learning in Embedded Systems”**, covering the end-to-end process from model design and compression to hardware-aware deployment.

This repository evolves across multiple editions of the workshop, incorporating feedback and improvements from different academic and professional training contexts.


## Course Instances
